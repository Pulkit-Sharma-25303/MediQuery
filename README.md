# MediQuery: AI-Powered Electronic Health Record (EHR) System

MediQuery is a full-stack web application designed to centralize patient and doctor information securely. It features a robust, role-based authentication system and integrates a local Large Language Model (Ollama) to provide intelligent analysis of medical data, including automated text extraction and summarization from uploaded PDF reports.

***

## Key Features

- üõ°Ô∏è **Role-Based Authentication**: Secure signup and login for two distinct user types‚Äî**Doctors** and **Patients**‚Äîwith strict, permission-based access controls.
- üë§ **Patient \& Doctor Management**: Full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing patient profiles, doctor directories, and detailed medical records.
- üìÑ **Automated Report Processing**: Upload PDF-based medical reports. The system automatically extracts the text using **PDFPlumber** and generates an **AI-powered summary**.
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis (Ollama)**: An integrated AI assistant allows doctors to **query a patient‚Äôs medical history**‚Äîincluding records, medications, and report summaries‚Äîusing natural language.
- üîí **Secure Data Access**: Patients can only view their own profiles and medical data, while doctors can only access the profiles of patients assigned to them.
- üíä **Medication Tracking**: Doctors can prescribe and manage a list of medications for each patient, including dosage and instructions.
